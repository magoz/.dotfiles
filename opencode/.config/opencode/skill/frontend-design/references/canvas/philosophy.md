# Canvas Design Philosophy

Visual design philosophy for sophisticated compositions.

## Two-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Philosophy Creation
Create aesthetic movement through form, space, color, composition. Not layouts - pure visual philosophy.

Structure (4-6 paragraphs):
- Space and form principles
- Color and material approach
- Scale and rhythm guidance
- Composition and balance
- Visual hierarchy system

### Phase 2: Visual Expression
Express through canvas:
- 90% visual design
- 10% essential text
- Museum-quality execution
- Systematic patterns

## Core Principles

### 1. Visual Communication First
Information lives in design, not paragraphs:
- Color zones and fields
- Geometric precision
- Spatial relationships
- Visual weight and tension

### 2. Minimal Text
Text as rare, powerful gesture:
- Never paragraphs
- Only essential words
- Integrated into architecture
- Typography as visual element

### 3. Expert Craftsmanship
Work must appear:
- Meticulously crafted
- Product of countless hours
- Master-level execution
- Museum-worthy quality

### 4. Systematic Patterns
Scientific visual language:
- Repeating patterns = rhythm
- Perfect geometric shapes
- Dense accumulation builds meaning
- Patient repetition rewards viewing

## Design Movements

### Concrete Poetry
Monumental form, bold geometry. Massive color blocks. Sculptural typography. Text as rare, powerful gesture.

### Chromatic Language
Color as information. Geometric precision. Color zones create meaning. Words only anchor what color shows.

### Analog Meditation
Quiet contemplation through texture. Paper grain, ink bleeds. Vast negative space. Images breathe across pages.

### Organic Systems
Natural clustering, modular growth. Rounded forms, organic arrangements. Information through diagrams.

### Geometric Silence
Pure order and restraint. Grid precision. Dramatic negative space. Swiss formalism meets Brutalist honesty.

## Implementation

### Color
```css
@theme {
  --color-primary: oklch(0.55 0.22 264);
  --color-accent: oklch(0.75 0.18 45);
}
```

Limited (2-5), cohesive, purposeful relationships.

### Typography
- Light weights (200-300)
- Clean sans-serifs
- Geometric precision
- Small for labels, large for rare impact

### Composition
- Repeating patterns establish rhythm
- Perfect geometric shapes
- Nothing falls off page
- Nothing overlaps unintentionally
- Proper margins non-negotiable
